Partial instance examples:

  - chameleon (by Alcino)

  - sudoku

  - squander-style for pure functions

      - hamiltonian path    
      - top sort
      - k clique
      - k coloring

Staging examples:

  - iteratively/binary increasing/decreasing scope
  - max clique
  - traveling salesman problem
  - longest path
  - prim's algorithm

Dynamic symmetry breaking:

  - think of some examples
  - this will require adding additional constraints when asking for 
    next solution, which might not be trivial (maybe Kodkod's
    incremental solving can help)

Specification testing

  - seq filtering


TODO: 

  - formalize scope computing

  - implment libraries (e.g., ordering, seq)

  - have model specific config options
  - add interface for passing options when running solver
  - create some class corresponding to Alloy's CompModule
  - move all the initialization stuff from Arby.meta to CompModule
  - unify the implementation of different kinds of relation (e.g., in
    relation.rb, tuple_set.rb, types.rb, etc.)

DONE: 

  - ensure initialization before solving
  - sudoku
